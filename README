naphy

----------------------------------------------------------

compiled and tested with mingw under windows
libraries for the native build are in lib/
the dlls from lib/ can be copied into the binary directory
files from res/ are copied into build/ by cmake

----------------------------------------------------------

supported shapes:
    - circle
    - convex polygon
collision detection using separating axis test
collision data compiled in an arbiter
sequential impulses for collision correction
springs simulated using hooke's law
spatial indexing using quad trees

----------------------------------------------------------

src/naphy
    * core engine
src/gui
    * very basic gui
src/rend
    * wrappers for sdl renderer and related structures
src/utility
    * input/output, math header, timing
src/game
    * applicative layer for naphy
    * entites built with relational model instead of oop
src/test
    * demonstration scenes

----------------------------------------------------------

can't be used for much because:
    - stacking bodies fall apart
    - springs break under poor strength/damping coefs
    - no continuous collision detection
